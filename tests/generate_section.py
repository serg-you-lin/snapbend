tests/generate_section.py
---------------------------
Generate the golden-set sections (L / U / Z / O) into data_4_cloude/sections/.

One section per shape x thickness (1, 3, 10), with a fixed 1 mm inner
radius. The radius does NOT enter the flat-length calculation: it only
serves the recognition pattern "this is bent sheet metal". Geometrically
impossible combinations (a segment shorter than its neighbouring radii)
are skipped and reported.

Each section is written in two formats:
  - .dxf  : via forge (to look at it / feed the drawing interpreter)
  - .json : neutral entities + parameters (for tests, via
            forge.load_geometry, without going through a DXF file)

Usage:
    python tests/generate_section.py
